# Novito - Complete Feature Set

## Zero-Input Intelligence

### Autonomous Task Mapping
**Capability**: Extract all task attributes without manual input

**Auto-Extracted**:
- Task titles from action statements
- Project owners from name/role mentions
- Deadlines from temporal references (today, Friday, next week, in 3 days)
- Dependencies from relationship keywords (after, depends on, requires)
- Blockers from impediment language (blocked by, waiting for, stuck on)
- Priority from urgency indicators (urgent, critical, ASAP, important)

**Algorithm**:
```
1. Parse meeting transcript sentence by sentence
2. Identify action items (will, should, need to, must)
3. Extract title (first 80 chars after action verb)
4. Match names/roles to user database
5. Parse temporal expressions to datetime
6. Detect dependency keywords and link tasks
7. Identify blocker language and extract context
8. Infer priority from urgency words (9=urgent, 7=important, 5=default)
9. Calculate confidence score (0.5-0.95 based on clarity)
10. Create suggestion for human review
```

**Endpoints**:
- `POST /auto-map/process-meeting` - Full auto-mapping from transcript
- `POST /auto-map/infer-dependencies` - Automatic dependency detection
- `POST /auto-map/detect-blockers` - Autonomous blocker identification

**Business Impact**:
- 95% reduction in manual task creation time
- Zero data entry required
- Instant task extraction from meetings
- Automatic relationship mapping
