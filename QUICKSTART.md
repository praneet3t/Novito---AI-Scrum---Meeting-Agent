## ðŸŽ¯ Key Concepts

### Agent Modes
- **Off** - No AI suggestions
- **Suggest** - AI suggests, human approves (default)
- **Auto** - AI auto-applies high-confidence suggestions

### Confidence Scores
- **90-100%** - Very confident, safe to auto-apply
- **80-89%** - Confident, review recommended
- **70-79%** - Moderate, careful review needed
- **<70%** - Low confidence, likely needs editing

### Audit Trail
- Every action logged
- Shows before/after state
- Reversible actions can be undone
- Tracks both human and AI actions

### Task Lifecycle
```
Todo â†’ In Progress â†’ Submit for Review â†’ QA â†’ Done
                â†“
            Report Blocker â†’ Manager Resolves
```
