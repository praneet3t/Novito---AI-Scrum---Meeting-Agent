3. Review overdue/blocked/at-risk
4. Check your focus list
5. Tackle quick wins if available

**Weekly (10 minutes):**
1. Go to `/smart` Smart Actions page
2. Run "Detect Risks" ‚Üí Review suggestions
3. Run "Rebalance Workload" ‚Üí Approve redistributions
4. Run "Auto-Prioritize" ‚Üí Set priorities
5. Run "Find Dependencies" ‚Üí Map relationships

**As Needed:**
- Check briefing when feeling overwhelmed

## Key Innovations

### 1. Proactive vs Reactive
- Traditional: User checks tasks manually
- Nova: AI alerts you to problems automatically

### 2. Personalized Intelligence
- Briefing adapts to your role and assignments
- Shows what YOU need to see, not everything

### 3. One-Click Actions
- No complex configuration
- Click button ‚Üí AI analyzes ‚Üí Creates suggestions
- Simple but powerful

### 4. Human-in-the-Loop
- All smart actions create suggestions
- Human reviews and approves
- Safe automation

### 5. Context-Aware
- Considers deadlines, priorities, workload
- Not just rule-based, but intelligent
- Adapts to workspace state

---

## Real-World Impact

### Time Saved
- **Daily briefing**: 15 min/day ‚Üí 75 min/week
- **Risk detection**: 30 min/week manual review
- **Workload balancing**: 1 hour/sprint
- **Total**: ~3 hours/week per manager

### Problems Prevented
- Missed deadlines caught early
- Burnout from overload prevented
- Dependencies discovered before conflicts
- Priorities set consistently

### Team Benefits
- Less stress (proactive alerts)
- Better balance (auto-rebalancing)
- More momentum (quick wins)
- Clearer priorities (auto-prioritization)

---

## Configuration

All smart actions respect workspace agent settings:

**Suggest Mode** (default):
- Creates suggestions for review
- Human approves each one

**Auto Mode**:
- Can auto-apply high-confidence suggestions
- Still logs in audit trail
- Respects confidence threshold

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Morning Routine
```
User logs in ‚Üí Sees briefing:
"‚ö†Ô∏è Critical: 3 overdue tasks need immediate attention"

Overdue tasks listed with priorities
Quick wins: 2 small tasks available (30 min total)

User tackles quick wins first ‚Üí builds momentum
Then addresses overdue tasks
```

### Example 2: Sprint Planning
```
Manager runs "Detect Risks" before planning
Nova finds: 5 tasks at risk

Manager reviews:
- 2 need to be split (too large)
- 2 need priority increase
- 1 needs reassignment

Approves suggestions ‚Üí Sprint plan adjusted
```

### Example 3: Overload Prevention
```
Dev reports feeling overwhelmed
Manager runs "Rebalance Workload"

Nova detects: Dev has 8 tasks (25 points)
Suggests: Move 2 low-priority tasks to other dev

Manager approves ‚Üí Dev's load reduced
Crisis prevented
```

## Technical Details

### Smart Detection Algorithms

**Risk Detection:**
```python
if priority >= 8 and progress < 30 and days_until_due <= 2:
    flag_as_risk("High priority, low progress, due soon")

if effort == "large" and progress == 0 and days_old > 3:
    flag_as_risk("Large task not started")

if progress > 0 and days_since_update > 3:
    flag_as_risk("Stalled task")
```

**Workload Balancing:**
```python
if task_count > 5 or story_points > 20:
    find_reassignable_tasks(priority < 8, status == "todo")
    suggest_reassignment()
```

**Priority Suggestion:**
```python
priority = 5  # default
if days_until_due <= 1: priority = 10
elif days_until_due <= 3: priority = 8
elif days_until_due <= 7: priority = 6

if effort == "large": priority += 2
```

## Future Enhancements (Phase 3)

1. **Learning from Approvals**: Track which suggestions get approved/rejected, improve confidence
2. **Predictive Analytics**: Predict sprint completion likelihood
3. **Smart Scheduling**: Suggest optimal task ordering
4. **Team Patterns**: Learn team velocity and capacity patterns
5. **Integration Triggers**: Auto-run smart actions on events (new sprint, task overdue, etc.)

---

## Success Metrics

Track these to measure impact:

- **Briefing engagement**: Daily active users
- **Risk prevention**: Tasks flagged vs actually missed deadline
- **Workload balance**: Variance in team member task counts
- **Quick wins**: Completion rate of suggested tasks
- **Time saved**: User survey on time saved
