## 🎯 Key Workflows Implemented

### 1. Meeting → AI Extraction → Review → Approve
```
1. Admin uploads meeting transcript (/meetings)
2. AI extracts tasks and creates suggestions
3. Admin reviews in Review Queue (/review)
4. Click "Approve" → calls PATCH /agent/suggestions/{id}/apply
5. Task created + audit log generated
```

### 2. Task Execution → Submit → Review
```
1. Member views My Tasks (/tasks)
2. Updates progress slider
3. Clicks "Submit for Review"
4. Calls PATCH /tasks/{id}/submit
5. Task moves to QA status with deadline
```

### 3. Report Blocker → Manager Resolves
```
1. Member clicks "Report Blocker" in task modal
2. Enters reason → calls PATCH /tasks/{id} with is_blocked=true
3. Manager sees blocker in /blockers page
4. Manager clicks "Mark Resolved" → updates task
```

### 4. Agent Configuration
```
1. Admin goes to /settings
2. Selects agent mode (off/suggest/auto)
3. Sets confidence threshold (for auto mode)
4. Selects allowed auto-actions
5. Saves → calls PATCH /workspaces/{id}/agent-mode
```

### 5. Audit & Undo
```
1. Admin views /audit page
2. Sees all agent actions with before/after states
3. Clicks "Undo" on reversible action
4. Calls POST /audits/{id}/undo
5. Action reverted
```

## 📝 What's Working

✅ Human-in-the-loop approval for AI suggestions  
✅ Audit trail with undo capability  
✅ Task submission workflow  
✅ Blocker reporting and resolution  
✅ Agent mode configuration (off/suggest/auto)  
✅ Confidence-based auto-apply  
✅ Role-based navigation  
✅ Real API integration (no mock data in critical flows)  

## 🔄 What's Still Mock/Demo

⚠️ Meeting processing (uses sample data, not real Gemini API)  
⚠️ Task list in TasksPage (uses hardcoded data, not API)  
⚠️ Dashboard charts (sample data)  
⚠️ Team management (basic UI only)  

## 🎯 Next Steps (Phase 2)

- Connect TasksPage to real API
- Implement real-time notifications
- Add task comments and attachments
- Sprint planning with drag-and-drop
- Advanced analytics
- Test case management UI
- Incident tracking UI
